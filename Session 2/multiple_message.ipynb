       "> 3 * Reinforcement Learning: In reinforcement learning, the algorithm learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties * The algorithm learns to maximize the cumulative reward over time by taking actions that lead to positive outcomes * Reinforcement learning is often used in scenarios where an agent needs to learn to navigate a complex environment or optimize a specific objective * Common algorithms used in reinforcement learning include Q-learning, deep Q-networks, and policy gradient methods *\n",
